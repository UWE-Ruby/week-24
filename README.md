## Speaking Your Own Language

One of ruby's strongest features is its ability to be spoken with varying 
dialects. That ability allows for the language to be more flexible and fluent
in given circumstances compared to other languages.

### Exercise

The objective of the exercise is to define a domain specific language.

#### Domain

You are free to choose any domain. You are welcome to define a language that
parallels an existing language you are already familiar or you may define an
entirely new domain.

> The final product of the exercise is to be able to parse the language
  but it does not necessarily have to execute some code. So if the DSL
  you defined piloted a moon rover or moved a character in a virtual game
  world you do not need to develop the actual moon rover code or the 
  adapter to send the right commands to the game world.

#### Complexity

You are free to define how complex the language is and how extensive this
language changes Ruby's dialect.

> Within the exercise time you will likely not be able to completely define
  the language with all of the nuances you wish to include. So you should strive
  to complete what you would consider one entire feature or vertical slice. 
  This may mean you are only able to parse the launch sequence of your rover
  or the walk command for the game world character.

### Exercise Retrospective


### Reading

* [Ruby Metaprogramming](http://pragprog.com/book/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby)

    > Chapter 3 - Wednesday: Blocks

### Further Exercise

Within the short time allotted to the exercise you were likely only able to 
define the language or maybe one feature of the language done. With that as a
base, continue to build your language.

* Define the remaining features that you wrote down in your language 
  specification
  
* Further refine the language that you defined to make it even more flexible,
  more English, more verbose, or perhaps less verbose.

* If the language has a practical application, complete the implementation so
  that it is able to accomplished it's designed goal.
